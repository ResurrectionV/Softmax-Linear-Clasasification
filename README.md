## Overview

Linear classification stands as a fundamental pillar in the edifice of machine learning. In this project, we:

- **Delve into Theory:** Instead of building a custom neural network module with autograd for a softmax linear classifier, this notebook adopts a straightforward approach to illustrate the core concepts of linear classification.
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing:** Understand the cifar-10 image size and image precrossing.
- **Model Implementation:** Use Python to construct, train, and evaluate linear classifiers using libraries like PyTorch.
- **Visualization & Analysis:** Visualize decision boundaries and performance metrics through intuitive plots and graphs.
- **Validation:** Cross-Validation is applied to select proper hyperparameter for better generalization.
